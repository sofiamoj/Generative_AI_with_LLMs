# Generative AI with LLMs – Hands-on Labs (AWS & DeepLearning.AI)

This repository contains my personal implementations of three laboratory exercises from the "Generative AI with LLMs" professional course by AWS and DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.  
All code is independently written using Hugging Face models and Python for educational and research purposes.

## 🧪 Labs Overview

1. - [Lab 1 – Dialogue Summarization](Lab_1_summarize_dialogue/Lab_1_summarize_dialogue.ipynb)  
   - Summarize multi-speaker dialogues using transformer-based Large Language Models.
   - Focus on abstractive summarization techniques and evaluation of generated summaries.

2. (Lab_2_fine_tune_generative_ai_model/Lab_2_fine_tune_generative_ai_model.ipynb)  
   - Fine-tune a pre-trained generative model on domain-specific summarization datasets.
   - Includes preprocessing, training, evaluation, and saving fine-tuned models.

3. - [Lab 3 – Detoxifying Summaries](Lab_3_fine_tune_model_to_detoxify_summaries/Lab_3_fine_tune_model_to_detoxify_summaries.ipynb)
   - Reduce toxic or harmful content in automatically generated summaries.
   - Uses safety-aware fine-tuning and controlled text generation strategies.
